# Rateaway
The app was designed to be a social media platform specifically for restaurant owners to andvertise and for the general public to be able to find restaurants local to them. To create the app we opted to take a hybrid approach with HTML/CSS/JavaScript as opposed to to using a native approach due to time constraints. To turn the functions of the code into a more app like style we employed Framework7, this made styling and traversal through the app much easier to implement. We also used Cordova to convert the HTML/CSS/JavaScript code into a deployable app for both Anrdoid and IOS.
